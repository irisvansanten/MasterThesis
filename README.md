# Master Thesis
Thesis: How does missing data affect measurement error estimation in composite data sets when using MILC: A simulation study
Performed by: Iris van Santen
Supervised by: Ton de Waal and An-Chiao Lio
Institution: Leiden University

# Introduction
This repository provides all information and necessary files to replicate the simulation study.

# Software requirements
The whole thesis is coded with R. 

# Instructions
## Simulation Study
The simulation study was coded in one script, MAIN_MILC.R, with support of another script, FUN_help, that contains additional functions. Another two script were coded to obtain convergences plots, FUN_conv_plots.R, and perform a small study to demonstrate how the MAR procedure was implemented, FUN_MAR_procedure. 

## Application
The application was coded in one script called MILC_application.
