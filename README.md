## Introduction
This repository provides R-code to replicate the simulation study and R-code used to perform the application.


## Simulation Study
The simulation study was coded in one script, MAIN_MILC_simulation_study.R, with support of another script, FUN_help, that contains additional functions. The MAIN_MILC_simulation_study.R has to be runned once to obtain all results. Another R script contained code to obtain convergences plots, FUN_conv_plots.R, to check convergence. The last R script, FUN_SC_CV, performs a small study to calculate scaled probabilities and Cram√©r's V. 

## Application
The application was coded in one script called MAIN_MILC_application. The data set is not publicly available.
