Unstitution: 

# Introduction
This repository provides all information and necessary files to replicate the simulation study.

# Software requirements
The whole thesis is coded with R. 

# Instructions
The simulation study consists of three parts:
1. Generate data sets found in folder
2. Apply MILC found in folder
3. Statistical Analysis found in folder

A fourth folder contains scripts to generate the tables and figures given in the thesis report and a fifth folder contains files to reproduce the manuscript of the thesis report.
The repository contains the following files:

Folders/Files | Description
--- | ---
MILC_MAR | Script that performs simulation study
FUN_MILC_MAR | Script that contains main functions for simulation study
FUN_help_MILC | Script that contains help functions for simulation study
FUN_results | Script to present the results
FUN_rel_strength_MAR | Script to calculate the strength of MAR via Cramer's V
measurement_error | Script with population containing different meausurement error proportions
Tables | Folder in which the results in tables are presented
Figures | Folder in which the results in figures are presented
